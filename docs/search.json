    "text": "About the Author\nHey Everyone! My name is Dennis Espejo, I’m a master’s student in Higher Education at Penn GSE.\n\n\nMotivation Behind the Current Project\nThis project “Latino & Afro-Latino Landscapes: Geospatial Data Science Revealing Disparities in Philadelphia” is based off of my current research projects looking at the different post-secondary educational trajectories of different identities within the Latine identity. In this case, I’m looking at differing educational trajectories of Black or Afro-Latine, and White-Latines, two distinct identities that get aggregated under the Latine monolith. I hope to shed light on the differing experiences of diverse communities under the Latine monolith, to ensure a decrease of their marginalization through institutional data practices that lump everyone together in an umbrella “Latine/Hispanic” category.\n\n\nFun Facts\nIn my free time, I love to lift weights, play video games, read, and pet my cat Reymundo (pictured below).",

    "text": "Analysis\nAs expected, most buildings are neighboring their campuses, with the heaviest concentration of buildings in the University City Area. However, the median household incomes of census tracts containing college buildings are relatively low. The high concentration of college buildings in lower median household income tracts could be attributred to two causes\n\nThe adults who are reporting their incomes in census tracts with college buildings are post-secondary students who do not have a full time job. For example, there is a relatively high median income of the tracts with a CCP building. CCP is a commuter school in which many students are also part time students who likely have a full time job, and are not living in the area.\nThe history of gentrification in Philadelphia by post-secondary instiutions. For example, Temple University has an extensive history of gentrification within lower income neighboorhoods in North Philadelphia, as noted by the lighter yellow color scheme within census tracts that have a Temple building when toggling the “Median Household Income” choropleth map in the above folium map.\n\nMoreover, based on the choropleth maps seen in part 1.2, the areas that were noted to have heavy Black-Latino, and White-Latino concentrations have little to no college buildings within their census tracts.\nHowever, my previous rationale is only based off of direct observation of the Folium map. Part 2.3 will give a more concrete statistical analysis of the trends mapped above.",

Findings such as these can begin to cataylyze efforts in disaggregating Latino identity in data.\nSpecifically, these findings can influence organization, such as post-secondary institutions, to begin noticing the differences within racial identity within the broad Latine ethnicity. Highiltghing potential disapprities within the Latine identity can influence post-secondary institutions to begin allocating resources and support to more marginalized Latine racial groups.",

    "text": "Analysis\nBased on the provided correlation heatmap,\nThe relationship between post-secondary achievement rates and the presence of post-secondary school buildings within Philadelphia’s census tracts appears to be minimal.\nSpecifically, the number of college buildings (building_count) shows a correlation of almost 0 with both bachelor’s degrees or higher (r = 0.001) and a weak negative correlation with associates degrees (r = -0.192), indicating that an increase in college buildings is not strongly associated with higher post-secondary attainment.\nWhen distinguishing between Black-Latines and White-Latines, Black and Latino/Hispanic populations show a modest positive correlation with associate degree attainment (r = 0.171), whereas White and Latino/Hispanic populations display a stronger positive correlation (r = 0.256) with associate degrees.\nHowever, neither group demonstrates a significant positive relationship with bachelor’s degrees, and the presence of college buildings does not notably mediate these educational outcomes. These findings suggest that factors other than proximity to post-secondary institutions may play a more crucial role in influencing educational attainment within Latino communities, with White-Latines exhibiting somewhat higher associate degree attainment compared to Black-Latines\nMoreover, building off of our findings in 1.3, Black-Latino hispanics have a modest negative correlation with Median Household Income, indicating that the higher the Median Household Income, the lower the Black-Latin population, in comparison with White-Latinos who have no correlation with Median Household Income.",

    "text": "About this Project\nThis project, titled “Analyzing Educational and Socioeconomic Disparities for Latino and Afro-Latino Communities in Philadelphia Through Geospatial Analysis,” aims to use advanced geospatial techniques to explore the differences in both the educational attainment and socioeconomic status of diverse racial identities under the overarching Latine ethnic identity.\nSpecifically, this paper aims to examine the differences between socioeconomic status and academic achievement between Afro (Black) - Latines, and White-Latines in Philadelphia by visualizing both the median household income, and proximity to post-secondary instiutions of these communities.\n\n\nBackground\nThe identity, culture, and marginalization of Latine racial groups are prevalent topics in Latine ethnic studies. Latine persons vary phenotypically and culturally, and the grouping of the vastly different nationalities and races within the single monolith of “Latine” does not account for the diverse experiences held by those within this demographic. Under the Latine identity, Afro-Latines (persons who are racially Black but ethnically Latine) have their unique experiences obscured by the Latine monolith.\nTo further contextualize the differences of experiences between Afro-Latine persons and non-Black or White Latines, I’m pulling the following line from one of my working papers :\n” The Latine monolith, where Latine identity is viewed as a homogenous racial/ethnic identity, marginalizes the diverse identities and experiences within the community. For example, the experiences of a lighter-skinned Mexican-American from California are vastly different from the experiences of a dark-skinned Afro(Black)-Dominican in terms of mental health (Figuereo & Calvo, 2021), education (Dache et al., 2019; Haywood, 2017), and the labor market (Misael Galdámez et al., 2024). However, both the Afro-Dominican and Mexican-American identities fall under the category of “Latine,” obscuring their specific lived experiences.”\n\n\nResearch Questions\nTo examine the differences between socioeconomic status and achievement rates of Black-Latine and White-Latine communities across Philadelphia the following research questions were developed:\n\nWhat are the differences in Median Household Income of tracts that contain more Black and Latine/Hispanics in comparison to White and Latine/Hispanic?\n\nMoreover, this project’s second questions aims to further analyze the economic and educational disparities in relation to post-secondary institutions\n\nHow is post-secondary achievement rate (Associate, Bachelors Degree, and/or Master’s Degree) mediated by living in the same tract as a post-secondary school building(s).\n a) How does this trend differ between Black-Latines and White-Latines\n\n\n\nProject Requirements Satisfied\n\n“Data is collected through a means more sophisticated than downloading (e.g. scraping, API).”\n\nDemographic data is collected using the census API\nCensus tract geometries are loaded using pygris\n\n“Combines data collected from 3 or more different sources.”\n\nPygris, Census API, and college building data from OpenDataPhilly\n\n“Includes multiple interactive visualizations that include a significant interactive component (cross-filtering, interactive widgets, etc)”\n\nProject has two interactive choropleth maps using hvplot and folium, as well as a seaborn correlation heatmap with a tooltip.",
