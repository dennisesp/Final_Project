These implications address economic disparities and educational outcomes within diverse census tracts, particularly those with varying racial and ethnic compositions.\nEconomic\n\nThe income disparities between White-Latine and Black-Latine predominant tracts suggest underlying structural issues such as unequal access to quality education, employment opportunities, and housing. Comprehensive strategies that address these root causes are essential to bridge the income gap. This may include investing in affordable housing, enhancing access to vocational training, and ensuring equitable education funding.\nImplementing or expanding social support programs, such as affordable childcare, healthcare services, and financial assistance, can alleviate economic pressures on households in predominantly Black and Latine/Hispanic tracts, thereby contributing to increased household incomes.\n\nEducation\n\nThe finding that the presence of post-secondary institutions does not significantly impact achievement rates indicates that mere proximity to educational facilities is insufficient. Implying that educational instiutions are doing little to support their local communitie. Educational institutions should engage in active outreach and provide support services to effectively influence post-secondary attainment in their surrounding areas.\nTo improve post-secondary achievement rates, especially in communities with higher Black and Latine/Hispanic populations, there is a need for comprehensive support programs. Support programs may include mentorship programs, academic advising, financial aid counseling, and initiatives that address barriers such as transportation and childcare for their surrounding neighborhood environments. Aditionally, educational institutions should collaborate with local organizations to create pathways for students from underrepresented communities. Partnerships can facilitate access to resources, internships, and career opportunities that enhance educational outcomes.",

Unfortunately, my statistical training is limited, and when initially trying to incorporate a basic Altair correlation heatmap, I found this approach to not clearly define which variables were decreasing and which was increasing within the slight negative correlations that would appear.\nThe method in which I distinguished Black-Latines, and White-Latines may be limited by the presence of other demographics that may influence trends within the chosen census tracts. Future studies should do an additional analysis of seperate demographic variables to analyze how these correlate within census tracts that have more Black-Latines than White-Latines and vice-versa.\nUsing more sophisticated statistical analysis (such as Moran’s I) to test the influence of not only living within a census tract that has a post-secondary insititution, but also the effect of living in a census tract that neighboor’s a post-secondary instiution.",

My name is Dennis Espejo, I’m a master’s student in Higher Education at Penn GSE.\n\n\nMotivation Behind the Current Project\nThis project “Latino & Afro-Latino Landscapes: Geospatial Data Science Revealing Disparities in Philadelphia” is based off of my current research projects looking at the different post-secondary educational trajectories of different identities within the Latine identity. In this case, I’m looking at differing educational trajectories of Black or Afro-Latine, and White-Latines, two distinct identities that get aggregated under the Latine monolith. I hope to shed light on the differing experiences of diverse communities under the Latine monolith, to ensure a decrease of their marginalization through institutional data practices that lump everyone together in an umbrella “Latine/Hispanic” category.\n\n\nFun Facts\nIn my free time, I love to lift weights, play video games, read, and pet my cat Reymundo (pictured below).",

    "text": "Analysis\nAs expected, most buildings are neighboring their campuses, with the heaviest concentration of buildings in the University City area. However, at first glance, the median household incomes of census tracts containing college buildings are relatively low (noted by the lighter yellow color when the “Median Household Income” choropleth map is toggled). The high concentration of college buildings in lower median household income tracts could be attributred to two causes\n\nThe adults who are reporting their incomes in census tracts with college buildings are post-secondary students who do not have a full time job. For example, there is a relatively high median income of the tracts with a CCP building. CCP is a commuter school in which many students are also part time students who likely have a full time job, and are not living in the area.\nThe history of gentrification in Philadelphia by post-secondary instiutions. For example, Temple University has an extensive history of gentrification within lower income neighboorhoods in North Philadelphia, as noted by the lighter yellow color scheme within census tracts that have a Temple building when toggling the “Median Household Income” choropleth map in the above folium map.\n\nMoreover, based on the choropleth maps seen in part 1.2, the areas that were noted to have heavy Black-Latino, and White-Latino concentrations have little to no college buildings within their census tracts.\nHowever, my previous rationale is only based off of direct observation of the Folium map. Part 2.3 will provide an additional analysis of the trends mapped above.",

Findings such as these can begin to cataylyze efforts in disaggregating Latine identity in data.\nSpecifically, these findings can influence organizations, such as post-secondary institutions, to begin noticing the differences within racial identity within the broad Latine ethnicity.

    "text": "Analysis\nIn contrast to my initial insights from part 2.2, the Median Household Income is not lower in tracts that contain a college building. In fact, the Median Household Income appears to be a bit larger when compared to census tracts without a college building.\nMoreover, there is also little variation between the mean values of Associates and Bahcelors Degree within census tracts that have a buildings vs those that do not, indicating that the presence of a college building in the nearby area does little to mediate post-secondary achievement rates and Median Household Income.\nAdditionally, Black-Latine predominant tracts display lower socioeconomic indicators compared to the city average and tracts with a higher White-Latine population. Specifically, there is a lower mean number of individuals with a Bachelor’s degree but a higher mean number with an Associate’s degree.\nWhite-Latine/Hispanic predominant tracts demonstrate higher median household incomes and a more significant number of individuals holding a Bachelors degree, indicating better economic opportunities and higher educational attainment within White-Latine predominant tracts.\nThe previous findings hint that demographic compositions may play a more crucial role in shaping educational and economic landscapes within census tracts than the presence of post-secondary buildings. Future studies should continue to analyze other attributes that influence post-secondary achievement within different Latine racial groups.\nTo answer the second question;\n“How is post-secondary achievement rate (Associate/Bachelors Degree) influenced by living in the same tract as a post-secondary school building(s).\n\nHow does this trend differ between tracts that have more Black/Latines, than White/Latines and vice versa.”\n\nOverall, the presence of college buildings does not significantly impact post-secondary degree attainment levels. The influence of college buildings on post-secondary achievement rates does not differ between Census tracts have more Black/Latines, than White/Latines and vice versa",

    "text": "About this Project\nThis project, titled “Analyzing Educational and Socioeconomic Disparities for Latino and Afro-Latino Communities in Philadelphia Through Geospatial Analysis,” aims to use advanced geospatial techniques to explore the differences in both the educational attainment and socioeconomic status of diverse racial identities under the overarching Latine ethnic identity.\nSpecifically, this project aims to examine the differences between socioeconomic status and academic achievement between Afro (Black) - Latines, and White-Latines in Philadelphia by visualizing both the median household income, and proximity to post-secondary instiutions of these communities.\nFor this project, White-Latines will be defined as persons who marked their ethnicity as Latine, and race as White in the 2020 census. Similarly, Black-Latines are persons who marked their ethnicity as Latine, but race as Black.\nMoreover, for this project, I will use “Latine,” which is a grammatically cohesive and gender-neutral term encompassing all persons under the “Latino/a/x/e” identity.\n\n\nBackground\nThe identity, culture, and marginalization of Latine racial groups are prevalent topics in Latine ethnic studies. Latine persons vary phenotypically and culturally, and the grouping of the vastly different nationalities and races within the single monolith of “Latine” does not account for the diverse experiences held by those within this demographic. Under the Latine identity, Afro-Latines (persons who are racially Black but ethnically Latine) have their unique experiences obscured by the Latine monolith.\nTo further contextualize the differences of experiences between Afro-Latine persons and non-Black or White Latines, I’m pulling the following line from one of my working papers :\n” The Latine monolith, where Latine identity is viewed as a homogenous racial/ethnic identity, marginalizes the diverse identities and experiences within the community. For example, the experiences of a lighter-skinned Mexican-American from California are vastly different from the experiences of a dark-skinned Afro(Black)-Dominican in terms of mental health (Figuereo & Calvo, 2021), education (Dache et al., 2019; Haywood, 2017), and the labor market (Misael Galdámez et al., 2024). However, both the Afro-Dominican and Mexican-American identities fall under the category of “Latine,” obscuring their specific lived experiences.”\n\n\nResearch Questions\nTo examine the differences between socioeconomic status and achievement rates of Black-Latine and White-Latine communities across Philadelphia the following research questions were developed:\n\nWhat are the differences in Median Household Income of tracts that contain more Black and Latine/Hispanics in comparison to White and Latine/Hispanic?\n\nMoreover, this project’s second questions aims to further analyze the economic and educational disparities in relation to post-secondary institutions\n\nHow is post-secondary achievement rate (Associate and/or Bachelors Degree ) influenced by living in the same tract as a post-secondary school building(s).\n a) How does this trend differ between census tracts that have more Black-Latines than White-Latines, and vice-versa\n\n\n\nProject Requirements Satisfied\n\n“Data is collected through a means more sophisticated than downloading (e.g. scraping, API).”\n\nDemographic data is collected using the census API\nCensus tract geometries are loaded using pygris\n\n“Combines data collected from 3 or more different sources.”\n\nPygris, Census API, and college building data from OpenDataPhilly\n\n“Includes multiple interactive visualizations that include a significant interactive component (cross-filtering, interactive widgets, etc)”\n\nProject has two interactive choropleth maps using hvplot and folium, as well as two sets of altair bar graphs with a tooltip.",

    "text": "Research Question Conclusions\nBased on the present project’s analysis the answers to the research questions are as follows;\n1) On average, census tracts with a higher amount of Black Latine/Hispanics have a mean “Median Household Income” that is around $20,000 less compared to census tracts with a higher reported population of White Latine/Hispanics as reported in the 2020 American Community Survey\n2) Overall, the presence of college buildings does not significantly impact post-secondary achievement rates, and this does not differ between Census tracts that have more Black/Latines, than White/Latines and vice versa.",
