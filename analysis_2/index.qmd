**Goals of Part 2**

Part 2 is Dedicated to Answering the Following Research Question 

2) How is post-secondary achievement rate (Associate/Bachelors Degree) influenced by living in the same tract as a post-secondary school building(s). 
       
       a) How does this trend differ between tracts that have more Black/Latines, than White/Latines and vice versa.

**What you'll see in Part 2**

1) Downloading post-secondary building data geojson from OpenDataPhilly

2) Merging building geojson with original "Identity_Per_Tract" dataframe from Part 1

3) Creation of a folium map that plots the different post-secondary school buildings, along with the median income of each tract in Philadehlpia, and its Latine and White-Latine/Black-Latine population.  

4) Statistical analysis (Correlation Coefficient, Standard Error, & P-Value) of demographic variables 
and school buildings per census tract

5) Creation of a correlation heatmap with hvplot with a touchtip that shows the correlation, standard error, and p-value
between the relationships of all demographic variables and school buildings per tract
