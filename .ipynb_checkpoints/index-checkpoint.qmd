**About this Project**

This project, titled "Analyzing Educational and Socioeconomic Disparities 
for Latino and Afro-Latino Communities in Philadelphia Through Geospatial Analysis," 
aims to use advanced geospatial techniques to explore the differences in both the educational attainment and socioeconomic status of diverse racial identities under the overarching Latine ethnic identity.  



Specifically, this paper aims to examine the differences between socioeconomic status and academic achievement between Afro (Black) - Latines, and White-Latines in Philadelphia by visualizing both the median household income, and proximity to post-secondary instiutions of these communities.

**Background**

The identity, culture, and marginalization of Latine racial groups are prevalent topics in Latine ethnic studies.
Latine persons vary phenotypically and culturally, and the grouping of the vastly different nationalities and races within the single monolith of "Latine" does not account for the diverse experiences held by those within this demographic. Under the Latine identity, Afro-Latines (persons who are racially Black but ethnically Latine) have their unique experiences obscured by the Latine monolith.

To further contextualize the differences of experiences between Afro-Latine persons and non-Black or White Latines, I'm pulling the following line from one of my working papers :

" The Latine monolith, where Latine identity is viewed as a homogenous racial/ethnic identity, marginalizes the diverse identities and experiences within the community. For example, the experiences of a lighter-skinned Mexican-American from California are vastly different from the experiences of a dark-skinned Afro(Black)-Dominican in terms of mental health (Figuereo & Calvo, 2021), education (Dache et al., 2019; Haywood,
2017), and the labor market (Misael Gald√°mez et al., 2024). However, both the Afro-Dominican and Mexican-American identities fall under the category of "Latine," obscuring their specific lived experiences."

**Research Questions**

To examine the differences between socioeconomic status and achievement rates of Black-Latine and White-Latine communities across Philadelphia the following research questions were developed: 

1) What are the differences in Median Household Income of tracts that contain more Black and Latine/Hispanics
in comparison to White and Latine/Hispanic? 

Moreover, this project's second questions aims to further analyze the economic and educational disparities in relation to post-secondary institutions


2) How is post-secondary achievement rate (Associate, Bachelors Degree, and/or Master's Degree) for Latine communities mediated by living in the same tract as a post-secondary school building(s). 

        a) How does this trend differ between Black-Latines and White-Latines

**Project Requirements Satisfied**


1) "Data is collected through a means more sophisticated than downloading (e.g. scraping, API)."
    a) Demographic data is collected using the census API
    b) Census tract geometries are loaded using pygris

2) "Combines data collected from 3 or more different sources."
    a) Pygris, Census API, and college building data from OpenDataPhilly 
   
3) "Includes multiple interactive visualizations that include a significant interactive
component (cross-filtering, interactive widgets, etc)"
    a) Project has two interactive choropleth maps using hvplot and folium, as well as a seaborn correlation heatmap with a tooltip.
