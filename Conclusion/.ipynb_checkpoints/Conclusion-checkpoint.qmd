## Research Questions 

As a refresher this project's research questions were 


**1)** What are the differences in Median Household Income of tracts that contain more Black-Latine/Hispanics
in comparison to White-Latine/Hispanics? 

**2)** How is post-secondary achievement rate (Associate, Bachelors Degree, and/or Master's Degree) influenced by living in the same tract as a post-secondary school building(s). 

  a) How does this trend differ between tracts that have more Black/Latines, than White/Latines and vice versa.

## Research Question Conclusions 

Based on the present project's analysis the answers to the research questions are as follows; 

**1)** On average, census tracts with a higher amount of Black Latine/Hispanics have a mean “Median Household Income” that is around $20,000 less compared to census tracts with a higher reported population of White Latine/Hispanics as reported in the 2020 American Community Survey

**2)** Overall, the  presence of college buildings does not significantly impact post-secondary achievement rates, and this does not differ between Census tracts that have more Black/Latines, than White/Latines and vice versa.
