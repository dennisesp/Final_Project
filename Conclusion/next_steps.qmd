**Future Studies**

More research is necessary to explore the underlying factors contributing to the observed income disparities and the limited impact of educational infrastructure on post-secondary achievement. Understanding these mechanisms can inform more effective interventions.

Conducting longitudinal studies can provide insights into how economic and educational outcomes evolve over time in different census tracts, offering a deeper understanding of the long-term effects of policies and interventions.

Comparative studies between different regions or cities can identify best practices and successful strategies for addressing similar disparities, facilitating the replication of effective models in diverse contexts.
