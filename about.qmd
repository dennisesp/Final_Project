**About the Author**

Hey Everyone! My name is **Dennis Espejo**, I'm a master's student in Higher Education at Penn GSE.

  **Motivation Behind the Current Project**
  
  This project **"Latino & Afro-Latino Landscapes: Geospatial Data Science Revealing Disparities in Philadelphia"**
  is based off of my current research projects looking at the different post-secondary educational trajectories 
  of different identities within the Latine identity. In this case, I'm looking at differing educational trajectories 
  of Black or Afro-Latine, and White-Latines, two distinct identities that get aggregated under the Latine monolith.
  I hope to shed light on the differing experiences of diverse communities under the Latine monolith, to ensure a decrease
  of their marginalization through institutional data practices that lump everyone together in an umbrella "Latine/Hispanic"
  category.

  **Fun Facts**  

  In my free time, I love to lift weights, play video games, read, and pet my cat Reymundo (pictured below).
